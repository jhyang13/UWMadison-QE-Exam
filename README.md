# Ph.D. Qualifying Exam

## Department of Mechanical Engineering, Area Exam Information (Rev. Dec 9, 2020)

This repo provides details about the Area Exam portion of the Qualifying Exam. General information about the Exam is available in the ME Graduate Student Handbook.

### Solid Mechanics (Rudraraju, Revised June 15, 2018)

- Topics covered include the syllabus of ME 306 (Mechanics of Materials) offered at UW-Madison, Applications of Energy methods and Elements of Theory of Elasticity. Broadly, the scope of the exam will be based on the following two books:
  - Mechanics of Materials, Beer, Johnston, DeWolf, Mazurek, 7th Ed.
  - Advanced Mechanics of Materials, R.D. Cook and W. C. Young, 2nd Ed.
- Open book. Each student is permitted to bring no more than two textbooks to the exam. Books may be examined by the proctor to ensure that they do not contain added material that might give an unfair advantage to a student. None of them can be a solution manual, and they should not have any additional pages beyond the original published material.
- Greater emphasis is placed on conceptual clarity and solution methodology rather than the solution numbers.

### Materials Processing (Turng, Revised November 30, 2015):

- Closed book, closed notes.
- The level of the exam is at that of students who have passed ME 313 Manufacturing Processes. The textbook for ME 313 would be useful to review for students from schools other than UW-Madison.
- Text: Kalpakjian, S. & Schmidt, S.: Manufacturing Engineering & Technology, 4th ed., Prentice Hall, Polymer Processing Fundamentals, Hanser Publishers, (1997).
- Topics that could appear:
  - Mechanical and thermal properties of materials
  - Major material characterization methods
  - Major material processing methods
    - a. Metals: die casting, sand casting, investment casting,
    - b. Machining: broaching, drilling, grinding, milling, planing, shaping, sawing, and turning,
    - c. Plastics: injection molding, extrusion, compounding, thermoforming, film blowing, and blow molding
    - d. Additive manufacturing
    - e. Composites, alloys, and blends
- Dimensional analysis, dimensionless variables, and similarity and scaling
- Basic governing equations for fluid flow and heat transfer and their simplifications and analytical solutions
- Other relevant topics that fall into the basic scope of materials processing and manufacturing
